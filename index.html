								<p>
									My journey to becoming a psychologist was shaped by a deep curiosity about the human Mind. I have always been captivated by how each person experiences the world in their own unique way. This diversity inspired me to dedicate my life to understanding it.
								</p>
								<p>
									I believe that no two people's stories are the same, and that makes the work of a psychologist both challenging and deeply rewarding. My desire to help people is rooted in the belief that every individual has the potential to grow, heal, and find peace—sometimes they just need the right tools and support to get there.
								</p>
								<p>
									At Mantrana, I strive to create a safe, non-judgmental space where every individual can feel seen and heard. Whether you are facing life's toughest moments or seeking deeper self-understanding, I am here to talk with you, offering compassion and tailored guidance that respects your unique experiences.
