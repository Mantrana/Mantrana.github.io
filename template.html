									Individual therapy provides a confidential and supportive environment for adults (18 years and older) to explore their mental health challenges. This service is designed for clients facing a range of issues, including grief, mood regulation, stress, trauma, and anxiety. With a focus on evidence-based practices, therapy is tailored to meet each individual's unique needs and circumstances.

								</p>

								<p class="section-text">
									Incorporating expressive art therapy, clients engage in creative processes that facilitate emotional expression and insight. This therapeutic modality allows individuals to explore their feelings in a non-verbal way, promoting self-discovery and healing. Together with the psychologist, clients develop coping strategies, enhance emotional resilience, and work toward achieving personal goals for mental wellness.

									Children&apos;s therapy is specifically designed to address the developmental and emotional needs of young individuals. This service caters to children facing challenges such as mood regulation, hyperactivity, screen addiction, and behavior modifications. Through play therapy, a safe and engaging environment is created, allowing children to express their thoughts and emotions freely.

								</p>

								<p class="section-text">
									This therapeutic approach utilizes play as a means for children to communicate and process their feelings, enabling them to develop healthier coping mechanisms and social skills. The psychologist collaborates closely with parents and caregivers to ensure a holistic approach that fosters growth and understanding both at home and in therapy, helping children build resilience and emotional intelligence.

									Psychological testing is a specialized psychological assessment method that enables clients to reveal their underlying thoughts, emotions, and personality traits. This approach is utilized to gain deeper insights into an individual&apos;s psyche, helping to uncover subconscious conflicts and themes that may influence their behavior and emotional well-being.
								</p>

								<p class="section-text">
									This type of testing is particularly beneficial for clients who may find it challenging to articulate their feelings or for those dealing with complex psychological issues. The results provide valuable context for understanding a client's challenges and inform tailored therapeutic interventions.

								<p class="section-text">
									My journey to becoming a psychologist was shaped by a deep curiosity about the human Mind. I have always been captivated by how each person experiences the world in their own unique way. This diversity inspired me to dedicate my life to understanding it.
								</p>
								<p class="section-text">
									I believe that no two people's stories are the same, and that makes the work of a psychologist both challenging and deeply rewarding. My desire to help people is rooted in the belief that every individual has the potential to grow, heal, and find peaceâ€”sometimes they just need the right tools and support to get there.
								</p>
								<p class="section-text"> 
									At Mantrana, I strive to create a safe, non-judgmental space where every individual can feel seen and heard. Whether you are facing life's toughest moments or seeking deeper self-understanding, I am here to talk with you, offering compassion and tailored guidance that respects your unique experiences.
